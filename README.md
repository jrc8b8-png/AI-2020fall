## Syllabus of Artificial Intelligence (CMPSCI 4300/5300) - 2020 Fall

## A. Class and office hours
* Instructor: [Badri Adhikari](http://umsl.edu/~adhikarib/)
* Email: [adhikarib@umsl.edu](mailto:adhikarib@umsl.edu)
* Class meets: `TR 12:30PM - 1:45PM` (via Zoom)
* OfficeÂ hours: I will be available for up to 30 minutes after each class to answer your questions. If this time does not work for you, please email me and we can find a time that works for you and me.

## B. About the course (Official course description)
* This course provides an introduction to artificial intelligence (AI). The list of topics may include artificial neural networks, search, planning, knowledge-based reasoning, probabilistic inference, machine learning, natural language processing, and practical applications. \[3 credit units\].

## C. Prerequisites  
* CMPSCI 3130 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) or Graduate Standing in CS

## D. Learning outcomes  
I teach this course differently. Although I cover the book's chapter topics, the focus of the course is on the [ToDo: activities](). The activities are the heart of the course. I believe that you will learn more from the lectures when you watch them at home. So, I have recorded the chapter lectures for you to watch at home. During class, we will focus on activities. I will provide you the technical support you need to complete the activities. We all learn more by `doing` and this is exactly what we will do in this course. Below are the learning outcomes:
* Use Python, Numpy and Keras to design, train, and evaluate basic feed-forward neural networks
* Learn artificial intelligence principles and approaches
* Learn a basic understanding of the building blocks of AI as presented in terms of intelligent agents
* Evaluate various searching algorithms
* Understand problems and ideas in the field of natural language processing, perception, and robotics
* Learn the philosophical foundations of AI and the future of AI
* Implement various AI algorithms such as depth-first search, and breadth-first search.

## E. Textbook  
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) by [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-3rd-Edition/9780136042594.html).

## G. Course materials  
* All course materials are inside the relevant folders in Github location
* Chapter slides are [here](./chapter-slides/)
* Recorded lectures of the chapters are [here](./LECTURES.md)
 
## H. Course schedule
<img src="schedule.png" width="1000"/>

## I. General policies
* Keep yourself out of plagarism; Read [UMSL's Policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html); Our `turnitin` tool automatically checks for plagarism; Here is an [example](supporting_files/turn-it-in.png).
* Lecture recordings, audio or video, are not permitted.

## J. Programming language
* Python3 is language for the course; you are expected to use Python3 for all of your classroom activities, homeworks, and project.
* You are also required to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your own hosted Jupyter Notebook for running your programs.

## K. Late policy  
* You can request a maximum two-day extension on any homeworks or project submissions - for up to two submissions. 
* If you email me a few hours before a deadline and I don't reply you immediately, and if you have not used your two-day extensions, you can assume that the extension is granted automatically.
* Once you use your extension days, late submissions will get no points.

## L. Course project
* See [here](PROJECT.md).

## M. Classroom activities
* See [here](activities/README.md).

## N. Homeworks
There will be two types of homeworks:  
1. Writing chapter summaries, and 
2. Project phases (see [ToDo: project]())

Instructions for writing chapter summaries:
1. Submit at least a one page summary (at least 500 words) of the chapter.
1. All text must be `in your own words` and anything copied must be quoted and cited appropriately.
1. Use bullets only when appropriate - your summary cannot be all bullets.
1. Don't copy/paste images or equations from the slides or from the Internet - if you do, please cite the source right below the figure or equation.
1. You are encouraged but not required submit your homeworks using <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>.
1. All homeworks will be automatically checked for plagarism using the Canvas plugin Turnitin. If you copy/paste contents from the Internet, you will receive a `zero` for your submission. Serious actions will be taken for any repeated plagarism.

## ~~Tests~~
* There will be short tests (maximum 30 minutes) almost every week on Wednesdays (see the course schedule).
* If you miss a test (on topic A) and send me an email by the end of next day with a valid reason, your score in the next test (on topic B) will be copied as your score for the test you missed. However, in the test that you appear, you may be asked questions from both topics (A and B) while all others will receive questions only on topic B.
* Tests will be CLOSED book, CLOSED notes, and CLOSED electronics.
* Use of any type of electronics is strictly forbidden during tests.
* It is your responsibility to contact the instructor if you miss a test. If you don't, a grade of zero points will be assgined for the test you miss.

## ~~Attendance~~
* Attendance will be recorded frequently
* More than 5 uninformed absenses may lead to failing the course

## Grade composition  
* ~~10 * 3 points = 10 Tests~~
* ~~20 * 1 points = 20 Activities~~
* Before spring break:
  * 4 * 1 points = 4 Homeworks
  * 1 * 3 points = 1 Homework (learning how to learn online)
  * 3 * 3 points = 3 Tests
  * 10 * 1 points = Activities 1 through 12 [two optional activities for bonus] (before spring break)
  * 10 points = Project (phase I)
* After spring break:
  * 4 * 2 points = 4 Homeworks
  * 10 * 2 points = Activites 13 through 24 [two optional activities for bonus]
  * 30 points = Project (remaining phases)
  * 1.5 bonus point to everyone who complete the course evaluation survey

#### Project (40 points)
* 10  points = Data analysis & preparation
* 10  points = Model selection & evaluation
* 5  points = Feature importance and reduction
* 5  points = Addressing peer-reviews
* 10 points = Final report ~~Poster presentation (score from external judges, peers, and instructor)~~

## Grading scheme  
* Unless you chose to be graded as S/U (given that the university allows it), following grading scheme will be used
